You'll learn about the essential building blocks like \"layers\", \"nodes\", \"arrows\", \"weights\", \"loss\", \"cost function\", etc. You'll learn that a neural network general consists of several layers, and how a logistic regression model can be represented as a neural network with just one layer. You'll be able to explain what the advantages and disadvantages of using neural networks are, and get an insight of how forward and backward propagation are used in neural networks to minimize the loss and \"optimize\" your neural network.\n", "\n", "### Introduction to Keras\n", "You'll be introduced to Keras, open source neural network library in Python, which makes building neural networks surprisingly easy.
